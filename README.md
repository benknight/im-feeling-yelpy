# Iâ€™m Feeling Yelpy

If you ever have a specific business in mind and you want to quickly get to their Yelp page, the experience is frustratingly drawn out on www.yelp.com.  It goes something like 1. Navigate to www.yelp.com, 2. Type search query press enter, 3. Get taken to search, 4. Click the search result for the business.  With this extension you get taken directly to a Yelp business page from the Chrome Omnibox using a single search query.  

This works by running your query concatenated with the string "yelp" through Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature.  If your search query is specific this consistently lands you on the business page you were looking for. The extension will also give you search suggestions via the Yelp public API.

## How to Use

1. Enter keyword `biz` into the Omnibox, followed by hitting the space bar, or tab.  You may want to change this keyword in case it "conflicts" with something else that Chrome wants to autocomplete for you.
1. Type your search term.  The more specific, the better e.g.  *Tartine Bakery SF*, *Katz Deli NY*.
